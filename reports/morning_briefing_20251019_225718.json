    "summary": "Okay, here's my analysis based on the provided data:\n\n**1. Executive Summary:**\n\nThe hospital is currently operating near capacity with a slightly concerning AQI level. Elevated respiratory cases coinciding with the \"Unhealthy\" AQI suggests a potential strain on resources, requiring proactive monitoring and resource allocation.\n\n**2. Top 3 Priority Actions for Hospital Administrators:**\n\n*   **Monitor Respiratory Case Influx:** Closely track the number of respiratory cases and analyze trends to anticipate potential surges related to the poor air quality.\n*   **Implement Air Quality Mitigation Strategies:** Explore options to improve indoor air quality (e.g., HEPA filters) within the hospital to protect patients and staff.\n*   **Resource Optimization & Preparedness:** Review bed availability and staffing levels, and implement contingency plans if respiratory cases increase further and the admission rate for respiratory cases exceeds 20% of the total number of admissions\n\n**3. Risk Assessment:**\n\n**Medium**\n\n*   **Rationale:** The \"Unhealthy\" AQI (179.26) combined with a relatively high number of expected hospital admissions (56) and a low number of available beds (50) poses a moderate risk. The presence of 7 respiratory cases further elevates the risk, indicating a potential for increased demand on respiratory equipment and staff. While bed capacity is currently \"Normal,\" the small margin between available beds and expected admissions necessitates careful monitoring and proactive planning.\n",
